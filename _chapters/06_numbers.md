Learning mathematics, can feel overwhelming, because of the huge, even infinite, body of knowledge: how do you proceed so big of a task? But it turns out the answer is simple: you start off knowing 0 things, 0 theories. Then, you learn 1 theory - congrats, you have learned your first theory and so you would know a total of 1 theories. Then, you learn 1 more theory and you would already know a total of 2 theories. Then learn 1 more theory and then 1 more and, given enough time and dedication, you may learn all theories.

This little argument applies not only to learning mathematical theories, but to everything else that is "countable", so to say. This is because it is the basis of the mathematical definition of natural numbers, as famously syntesized in the 19th century by the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano:

1. $0$ is a natural number.
2. If $n$ is a naturan number, $n+1$ is a natural number.

And then, he gave the following laws.
