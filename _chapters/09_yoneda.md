Yoneda lemma
===

When thinking about some mathematical objects such as a groups, orders or categories, we often feel a need to get to the souce. We start asking ourselves what is "groupness" or "orderness". Like, given some (or any) set of objects, what is the ultimate group that we can create out of these objects - a group that includes all other groups, group such that all other groups are just a special case of it. Or the ultimate order? The ultimate category?
