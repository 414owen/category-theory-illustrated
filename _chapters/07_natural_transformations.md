Natural transformations and advanced concepts

We will now continue  

What are natural transformations
===

Functors don't form a category, but they actually do.

Interlude: Naturality explained

Isomorphism is not hard to construct - given two sets, containing three objects each, there are three isomorphisms that connect them, and that number grows exponentially. 

But most of these isomorphisms, are just random. In our studies we are only interested in structures that *make sense*. In category theory the abstract notion of making sense is captured by the naturality condition.

Adjunctions

Left adjoints preserve joins and right adjoints preserve meets. 

Monads

Hom functors

Representable functors
===

Representable functors are set-valued functors that are isomorphic to the Hom functor

A Hom-functor can always be converted to any set-valued functor (Yoneda lemma). But not the other way around

So a functor is representable when we can convert its values to values of the Hom functor
