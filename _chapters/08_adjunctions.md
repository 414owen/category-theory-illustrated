In this chapter we will continue with this *leit motif* that we developed in the previous two chapters - to begin each of them by introducing a new concept of equality between categories (and furthermore, for each new type of equality to be more relaxed than the previous one.)

We started the chapter about functors by reviewing *categorical isomorphisms*, which are invertable functions between categories.

Then in the chapter on *natural transformations* we saw categories that are equivalent up to an isomorphism.

And now we will relax the condition even more and will review a relationship that is not exactly an equality, , but it is not non-equality either. It is not two-way, but at the same time it is not exactly one-way as well. A relationship called *adjunction*. 

As you can see, I am not very good at explaining, so I got some examples alligned. But before we proceed with them, we will go through some of the basic terminology.

Like equivalence, adjunction is a relationship between two categories. Like equivalence, it is composed of two functors.

However, unlike equivalence, an adjunction is not symmetric i.e. although the two functors are two way and we 

$F \bullet G \cong  id_{D}$

$G \bullet F \cong  id_{C}$

$F \bullet G \to id_{D}$

$G \bullet F \to id_{C}$

Tensor-Hom adjunction

The tensor-hom adjunction is actually a codename for the curry-uncurry function that we saw earlier.

-- Left adjoints preserve joins and right adjoints preserve meets. 

-- Free/forgetful adjunctions are ones where the unit is Id.
