Under the section "Maximum and Minimum", I wasn't sure if the "maximum element" was being defined as being an element "bigger than all other elements" or defined as an element "not smaller than any element".

In addition, the following sentence and diagram is a bit confusing. The red and green are not bigger than all other elements (so maybe the maximum definition is "not smaller than any element"?).



# First possible typo

With respect to category theory, it states.

> 1. We have a morphism from any of the elements of the coproduct to the coproduct, so Y → G and B → G.

Then, with respect to orders, it states.

> 1. It is bigger than both of these objects, so Y ≤ G and P ≤ G.

I suspect that correct statement may be "so Y ≤ G and B ≤ G" because "P" is not defined yet and it didn't draw a parallelism with the aforementioned category theory statement.

# Second possible typo

With respect to category theory, it states.

> 2. For any other object P that also has those morphisms, so for any P such that P ≤ G and P ≤ B, we would have morphism G → P.

Here my intuition thinks it should be "so for any P such that Y ≤ P and B ≤ P"

With respect to orders, it states.

> 2. It is smaller than any other object that is bigger than them, so for any other object P such that P ≤ G and P ≤ B then we should also have G ≤ P

Here my intuition thinks it should be "so for any other object P such that Y ≤ P and B ≤ P then we should also have G ≤ P"

Take this comments with a grain of salt, since I am no mathematician and these comments are based on intuition rather than logic.
